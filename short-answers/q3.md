# Question

What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism describes the concept of using different classes with the same interface. In other words. Classes that do the same or similar things. For example, I can have a Piece class for my Chess Board and My Piece class can extend into my King class for my King Piece. So any properties/methods used in the piece class can be inherited by the king class and overridden if need be. As shown below

```js
class Piece {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }
  validMove() {
    //logic for valid move (to be overridden)
  }
}

class King extends Piece {
  constructor(color) {
    super(color);
  }
  validMove() {
    //overrides original
  }
}
```
